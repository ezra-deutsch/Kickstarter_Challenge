# Kickstarter_Challenge

## Overview of Project

To learn how to analyze a basic dataset in MS Excel and use statistical tools to gain insight.

### Purpose

To provide Louise with market data regarding other Kickstarter campaigns, and to suggest strategies with her launch of her play titled "Fever."  

## Analysis and Challenges

The dataset used is from Kickstarter which contains 4114 campaigns across many different categories and countries.
This analysis focuses specifically on Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes Based on goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This analysis focuses on the Parent Category, Theater, and gives us a view into how campaigns perform (Successful, Failed, Canceled) over the calander months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis focuses on the Subcategory, Plays, and shows the Outcomes of the campaigns segmented by monetary goal size.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The dataset contained a failed campaign with a goal of $100,000,000. An outlier this large makes it difficult to decide if the observation should be included in the analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

1. Most Kickstarter campaigns are attempted in the month of May.
2. May has the highest likelyhood of a campaign being successful (111).

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes Based on Goals?

1. Most Kickstarter campains (534) are attempted between $4,999 and $1,000.
2. Campaigns of $4,999 and less have a an average success rate of 74%. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset is specific to Kickstarter. Are there other fundraising platforms that have higher success rates? Or a platform that is better tailored to plays that Louise could use to increase her chance at success?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I think it would be useful to see how the data trends Year over Year. Do the campaigns become more successful in more recent years?
